`goslice` is a small package for some utility functions around Golang slices. Can be used for:

- checking if a slice contains a specific element
- comparing two slices

## Does it make sense to use this package ?

Well, actually maybe not really as you're importing one complete package for functions that can easily implemented on their own. So using this package certainly does make your application bigger.

However, using this package makes me happy :)

## Usage

1. `go get github.com/rescDev/useless-side-projects/goslice@<version>`
